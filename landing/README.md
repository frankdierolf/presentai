   # Pocketbase connection (adjust to your pocketbase service URL)
   NUXT_PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=https://your-pocketbase-domain.com

### Troubleshooting

**Build Issues with Nixpacks:**
If you encounter `oxc-parser` native binding errors, use Docker Compose deployment instead of Nixpacks. This is a known issue with Nuxt 4 on Nixpacks environments.

**Pocketbase Connection:**
Ensure the `NUXT_PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL` environment variable points to your deployed Pocketbase instance.
